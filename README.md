# Stardew-ChangeProfessions

This mod makes it easy to change a profession of a skill. Clicking on a profession on the skill page opens the level up menu where you chose the profession initially, giving you the ability to choose again.

This encourages experimentation and removes punishment for making uninformed choices.

Keep in mind that the secondary profession (level 10) of a skill is based on which primary profession (level 5) you picked. The mod handles this in the following way: if you have chosen a secondary profession and you reset its primary, the secondary profession will be replaced by the first (left) secondary profession of the new primary. You can of course change the new secondary profession just as easily.
