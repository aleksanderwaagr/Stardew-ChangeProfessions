# Stardew-ChangeProfessions

This mod makes it easy to change professions.

Normally when you mouse over a profession on the skill page you get a small pop-up showing the current profession. With this mod you can click on this profession pop-up to re-open the level-up menu for this profession, giving you the ability to choose again.

This encourages experimentation and removes punishment for making uninformed choices.

Keep in mind that the secondary profession (level 10) of a skill is based on which primary profession (level 5) you picked. Changing a primary profession will therefore also change the secondary profession.

Compatible with Cooking Skill and Luck Skill, but changing those professions isn't yet supported.
