# Stardew-ChangeProfessions

This mod makes it easy to change professions. Clicking on a profession on the skill page re-opens the level up menu, giving you the ability to choose again.

This encourages experimentation and removes punishment for making uninformed choices.

Keep in mind that the secondary profession (level 10) of a skill is based on which primary profession (level 5) you picked. Changing a primary profession will therefore also change the secondary profession.
